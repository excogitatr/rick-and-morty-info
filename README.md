A simple app to demonstrate Clean Architecture with GraphQL and flutter_bloc

## Motivation

In [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/)'s words,

“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” (_[Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r95004/Refactoring_improving_the_design_of_existing_code.pdf)_, 1999, p. 22)

With this idea in mind, I wanted to demonstrate how we can make a simple app in production grade (and I hope I made my case).

## "Production level" implementations

- CI/CD with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Githooks to ensure clean commit and push
  - Pre commit formats with `flutter format`
  - Pre push checks the code with `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`
- Linting style with [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart)
- Test coverage with [Codecov](https://codecov.io/)
- Dependency Injection with [injectable](https://pub.dev/packages/injectable) and [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)
- Testing with [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito) and [bloc_test](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc_test)

## Installation

- Check if you are in the beta channel of flutter SDK and the version v2.0.1 or higher. [Instruction to change flutter channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels#how-to-change-channels).
- Clone the repo
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/excogitatr/rick-and-morty-info.git
  ```
- And then we can use the normal build and run procedure
  ```sh
  flutter pub get
  flutter run
  ```
- Some files like `*.freezed.dart`, `*.g.dart`, `*.iconfig.dart` are auto generated. If there is any issue from these files just run this command to regenerate them.
  ```sh
  flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
  ```
